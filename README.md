## Description 
Overfitting affects model interpretation when predictions are made out of random noise. To address this issue, we introduce a novel metric – Training Attention and Validation Attention Consistency (TAVAC) – for evaluating ViT model degree of overfitting on imaging datasets and quantify the reproducibility of interpretation.
